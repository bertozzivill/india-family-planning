# india-family-planning

Code to analyze a pilot study for a family planning game distributed to secondary schools in Karnataka, India. Our aim in this study was to develop, pilot, and assess an innovative tool: a tablet-based game which provides adolescents with information about puberty, reproductive health, and family planning while collecting data. Data points include: desired family size, timing of important life events, and identity of principal influencers of these decisions. For data, see https://osf.io/9ybjm/. 

## Pre-post assessment
An updated version of the game was deployed in Chennai, India in the summer of 2018. This version included a built-in pre/post game to assess knowledge gain. The data for this portion of the study is available [here](https://osf.io/gtfu5/files/).
